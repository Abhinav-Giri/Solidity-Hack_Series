/* What happened?
Transactions take some time before they are mined.
Transactions not yet mined are put in the transaction pool.
Transactions with higher gas price are typically mined first.
An attacker can get the answer from the transaction pool, send a transaction
with a higher gas price so that their transaction will be included in a block
before the original.
